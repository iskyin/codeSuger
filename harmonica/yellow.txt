Look at the stars,            2 3 2 3
Look how they shine for you,  2 3 2 3 5 2
And everything you do,        1 2 1 2 5 1
Yeah, they were all Yellow.   1 6 1 1 6 5

I came along,                 2 3 2 3
I wrote a song for you,       2 3 2 3 5 2
And all the things you do,    1 2 1 2 5 1
And it was called Yellow.     1 6 1 1 6 5

So then I took my turn,       2 3 2 3 5 2
Oh what a thing to have done, 1 2 1 2 5 1
And it was all Yellow.        1 6 1 1 6 5

Your skin                     1 6 6
Oh yeah, your skin and bones, 1 1 5 5 3 3
Turn into something beautiful,1 6 6 1 1 5 5 3 3
You know,                     1 6 6
you know I love you so,       1 1 5 5 3 3
You know I love you so.       1 1 5 5 3 3

I swam across,
I jumped across for you,
Oh what a thing to do.
Cos you were all Yellow,

I drew a line,
I drew a line for you,
Oh what a thing to do,
And it was all Yellow.

Your skin,
Oh yeah your skin and bones,
Turn into something beautiful,
And you know,
For you I'd bleed myself dry,

For you I'd bleed myself dry.          全部同上
